The closest relatives to the Flying Fox would likely be other bat species or something closely related because of evolution. If we look at phylogenetic trees built from ACE2 sequences, we'd expect other Pteropus species (since that's the genus Flying Foxes belong to) or similar bat species (Chiroptera) to be grouped nearby in the tree.
This phylogeny helps with conservation by showing which bat species are most at risk from habitat loss, climate change, or disease. Understanding these relationships allows for better protection strategies, ensuring the survival of key species that support ecosystems through pollination and seed dispersal.
